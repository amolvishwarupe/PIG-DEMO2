1. What is the total amount of petrol in volume sold by every distributer?

grp_petron = FOREACH petrol GENERATE Distributor , volumeIN;
grp = GROUP grp_petron BY Distributer;
c = foreach grp generate group , SUM(grp_petron.volumeIN);
dump c;

2. Which are the top 10 distributers ID's for selling petrol? Also display the amount of petrol sold in volume.

a = foreach petrol generate District_ID , volumeOUT;
grunt> a = foreach petrol generate District_ID , volumeOUT;
grunt> b = group a by District_ID;
grunt> c =foreacg b generate group , sum(a.volumeOUT);
grunt> ordr = ORDER d BY $1 DESC;
grunt> top_10 = LIMIT ordr 10;
dump top_10

3. List 10 years where consumption of petrol is more with the distributer id who sold it.

grunt> a = FOREACH petrol GENERATE District_ID , volumeOUT , Year;
 b = ORDER a BY $1 DESC
 grunt> c = LIMIT b 10;
 dump c;


4. Find the distributer name who sold petrol in least amount.
 a = FOREACH petrol generate District_ID , volumeOUT;
 ordr = ORDER a BY volumeOUT ;
 least = LIMIT ordr 1
dump least ;
